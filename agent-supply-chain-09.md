# AAI009: Agent Supply Chain and Dependency Attacks

### Description

Agent Supply Chain and Dependency Attacks target the ecosystem of components, tools, libraries, and services that AI agents rely on to function. This vulnerability class encompasses attacks on the development, deployment, and runtime dependencies of AI agents, potentially compromising agent security through trusted channels.

* **Development Chain Attacks** occur when malicious code or components are introduced during the agent development process, potentially compromising the agent before deployment.
* **Dependency Injection** happens when attackers exploit external libraries, plugins, or tools that agents depend on to perform their functions.
* **Service Chain Compromise** involves attacking the external services and APIs that agents rely on for extended functionality.

The impact of successful supply chain attacks can be particularly severe as they exploit trusted relationships and can affect multiple agents across different deployments.

### Common Examples of Vulnerability

1. Compromised agent development tools that inject malicious code during build processes.
2. Malicious plugins or extensions that exploit agent functionality.
3. Compromised external services that agents depend on for critical operations.
4. Poisoned agent dependencies that introduce vulnerabilities.
5. Manipulated deployment pipelines that compromise agent integrity.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1. Implement secure development practices:
   - Verified build processes
   - Code signing
   - Dependency scanning
   - Integrity verification
   - Secure artifact storage

2. Establish dependency management controls:
   - Regular dependency audits
   - Version pinning
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Dependency isolation
   - Update management

3. Deploy service security measures:
   - Service authentication
   - API security controls
   - Service monitoring
   - Redundancy planning
   - Service isolation

4. Create deployment security controls:
   - Secure deployment pipelines
   - Image signing
   - Deployment verification
   - Runtime security checks
   - Configuration validation

5. Implement monitoring and detection:
   - Supply chain monitoring
   - Dependency tracking
   - Behavior monitoring
   - Anomaly detection
   - Security scanning

### Example Attack Scenarios

1. An attacker compromises a popular agent development framework, injecting malicious code that creates backdoors in agents built using the framework. The backdoors persist through deployment and can be exploited later.

2. A sophisticated attack targets a commonly used agent plugin, modifying its behavior to exfiltrate sensitive data while maintaining normal appearance. Multiple agents across different organizations are affected.

3. An attacker compromises an external service that agents rely on for data processing. The compromised service begins returning manipulated data that influences agent decisions.

4. A malicious actor poisons a widely-used agent dependency, introducing vulnerabilities that can be exploited across multiple agent deployments.

5. An attack on the deployment pipeline allows the injection of unauthorized code into agents during the deployment process, compromising agent integrity across multiple systems.

Agentic AI software supply chain security refers to  securing the development, deployment, and maintenance of AI systems so  that it prevents risks arising from vulnerabilities or malicious activities in the software supply chain. This includes ensuring that all components, from libraries and frameworks to datasets and deployment environments, are trustworthy, secure, and resilient from potential threats.

Securing the AI agent’s /AI systems software supply chain is essential for ensuring the integrity, safety, and trustworthiness of AI systems. Given the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, its critical to  implement proactive security measures at every stage of the software lifecycle from development and data handling to deployment and monitoring. Effective supply chain security for AI will require a combination of technical solutions, governance, collaboration, and adherence to standards, all cumulatively focused  at reducing the potential risks and vulnerabilities inherent in complex AI systems. AI agent software supply chain security is a growing concern as AI systems become more integrated into critical infrastructure, applications, and services. Technically AI agent is essentially  an autonomous or semi-autonomous software component that uses AI or machine learning (AI/ML) models and data to make decisions or perform tasks on behalf of users or organizations. These agents may operate in any type of context, like personal assistants, autonomous vehicles, robotic systems,health systems, financial trading, and cybersecurity defenses.

The security of the AI agent software supply chain is critical to ensuring that AI systems operate reliably, ethically, and without being compromised by attackers. Below is the analysis of the  security issues associated with the AI agent software supply chain, focusing on vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and risks unique to these types of systems and mitigations.

 Complex set of Components
The AI agent software supply chain includes  multiple layers, from the development environment to the deployment and ongoing operation of AI models. Some key components include:

-Pre-trained models: Open-source or third-party models may contain vulnerabilities or backdoors.

-Training datasets: Data used to train AI models can be tampered with, poisoned, or manipulated.

-Software dependencies: Libraries and frameworks that AI agents rely on can have hidden vulnerabilities.

-Execution environments: Whether cloud-based, on-premises, or edge devices, the environment in which AI agents run can have security gaps.

-Data sets used to train the AI agents

-

Security issues:

-Dependency nightmare: AI agents have to rely on multiple external libraries and services, like any software,  which may be out of date or insecure, leaving them open to vulnerabilities.

-Opaque supply chains: AI agents can have complex and opaque supply chains, making it difficult to track where vulnerabilities or malicious modifications are introduced.

AI Software Supply Chain Components :The software supply chain for AI includes various elements:
-Development tools: IDEs, programming languages, libraries, and frameworks used to build AI systems.

-Datasets: AI models rely heavily on data, which may come from external or third-party sources. Ensuring data quality, provenance, and integrity is crucial.

-Third-party dependencies: Reusable code or pre-trained models sourced from open repositories, vendors, or external collaborators.

-Deployment environments: This includes the cloud services, servers, containers, and hardware used to run AI models.

-Data being used for training the models that provides input and or actions for AI Agents

Threats to AI Software Supply Chains:Different  threats can compromise the security of the AI agent’s software supply chain, including:
-Malicious code injection: Attackers may insert malicious code into libraries, frameworks, or dependencies used in AI models.

-Data poisoning: Bad actors might tamper with the training data to manipulate model behavior (e.g., by embedding biases or vulnerabilities).

-Model backdoors: Attackers can introduce backdoors into machine learning models, enabling them to exploit vulnerabilities after deployment.

-Supply chain attacks: Cyber attackers may compromise software distributors or package managers to distribute infected versions of AI tools or models.

-Intellectual property theft: Models, training data, or other AI assets could be stolen or misused.

-Adversarial inputs: Attackers can make subtle changes to inputs (e.g., images, text, sensor data) that may mislead AI agents into making incorrect decisions. 

-Poisoning: If attackers inject adversarial data during model training, the AI agent might learn incorrect patterns, which can be exploited later during deployment.

-AI agents deployed on edge devices (viz. IoT sensors, autonomous devices) can be vulnerable to physical attacks like tampering, local attacks, or network-based exploitation.

-AI agents running in cloud environments face the same risks as traditional cloud services, including data breaches, unauthorized access, or hijacking of resources. AI models in the cloud are susceptible to adversarial manipulation and or theft.

-AI agents may rely on third-party APIs, cloud services, or models that could become compromised or malicious, leaving them vulnerable to supply chain or dependency-based attacks

-Communications between AI agents and other systems/API’s  if not properly encrypted, sensitive data can be intercepted and used maliciously. Attackers can intercept and inject malicious data or commands into AI agent communications, manipulating their actions or causing misbehavior.

Mitigations for Securing the AI Software Supply Chain
To secure the AI agents software supply chain, various measures need to be implemented across the entire lifecycle:

Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
-Code audits and static analysis: Regular audits of code repositories, including open-source dependencies, to detect vulnerabilities.

-Secure coding practices: Employ security standards like OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)  and NIST SSDF to avoid common vulnerabilities.

-Dependency management: Use tools to manage and verify third-party libraries and dependencies. Ensure only trusted and verified versions of packages are used.Adoption of SBOM for AI Agent:.By documenting every dependency, every  library, 3rd party components, execution environment SBOM enables developers to gain a comprehensive overview of the tools software ecosystem.

-Version control and integrity checks: Implement version control mechanisms and cryptographic integrity checks ( checksums, signatures) to ensure that software components have not been tampered with.

Data Security
-Data provenance and integrity: Track the origin of datasets and ensure they have not been tampered with before or during use in model training.

-Data sanitization: Apply techniques such as adversarial testing to detect and eliminate poisoned or biased data before it is used for model training.

-Data encryption: Use encryption both in transit and at rest to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.

AI Agent’s Model Security
-Model validation and testing: Perform rigorous testing to validate the security of AI models, such as checking for adversarial vulnerabilities, backdoors, or unintended behavior.

-Secure model sharing: When sharing models across organizations or with third-party vendors, ensure model integrity and confidentiality using techniques like homomorphic encryption or trusted execution environments or confidential compute.

-Adversarial robustness: Ensure models are resilient to adversarial inputs, which are subtle manipulations designed to cause the AI system to misbehave.

Deployment & Monitoring
-Continuous monitoring: Once deployed, AI agents and AI systems should be continuously monitored for signs of unexpected behavior, backdoor activations, or performance degradation.

-Auditability: Establish mechanisms for auditing decisions made by AI agents and execution should be validated, especially in critical applications/functions (e.g., finance, healthcare, security).

-Zero-trust architectures: Implementing zero-trust models in the AI agent deployment environment to ensure that only authorized users and processes can interact with critical components.



Like Model cards, an AI agent card can be used for tracking the software supply chain of the AI agent, Ai Agent card  is a virtual identity or digital profile that represents a specific autonomous agent or digital worker executing in an  environment. Its metadata about the AI agent that may include the agent's function, capabilities, current state, and software components (SBOM)  its build from and dataset used to train it etc. This could include Agent ID: A unique identifier for each agent.Role: The specific function the agent performs, Status: The current state of the agent , Capabilities: The skills or tasks the agent can perform (e.g., data analysis), Interdependencies: Links to other agents or systems that the agent depends on or interacts with, Security Profile: Security controls/measures, such as access control, encryption protocols, that the agent must adhere to.

The use of agent cards can streamline and automate various processes in the supply chain, making them more efficient and secure. Software supply chain engineers can view the performance and status of agents, agent card can maintain an immutable record of activities and interactions, providing accountability and transparency. Its pertinent to ensure agent cards work seamlessly with existing software supply chain technologies and platforms and that  can be a challenge.Managing a large number of agents and their interactions requires sophisticated infrastructure and coordination and capacity to be able to read , parse model cards at different stages of the monitoring and detection systems.

Agent cards can also be used for tracking Agent Proverance, Several organizations are exploring AI agent provenance, especially where transparency, accountability, and regulatory compliance are critical. AI agent provenance is an essential tool for ensuring the transparency, accountability, and trust in AI systems. By providing an accurate and comprehensive record of an AI agent's lifecycle, from design and training to deployment and runtime operation, provenance makes it possible to track, understand, and enhance AI systems. There are challenges, including complexity and privacy concerns, implementing AI provenance is critical for mitigating bias, ensuring regulatory compliance, and providing explainability and transparency
