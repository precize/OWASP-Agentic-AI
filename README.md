# OWASP Top 10 for AI Agents - Candidate Framework

## Overview
This project documents the top 10 security risks specifically related to AI Agents, representing a comprehensive analysis of vulnerabilities unique to autonomous AI systems. The document provides detailed descriptions, examples, and mitigation strategies for each risk, helping organizations secure their AI agent deployments effectively.

## Purpose
As AI agents become increasingly prevalent because GenAI models, understanding and mitigating their security risks becomes crucial. This guide aims to:
- Identify and explain the most critical security risks in AI agent systems
- Provide practical mitigation strategies for each identified risk
- Help organizations implement secure AI agent architectures
- Promote best practices in AI agent security

## Project Structure
The documentation is organized into top ten main security risks, each covering a specific risk category:
1. Agent Authorization and Control Hijacking
2. Agent Untraceability
3. Agent Critical Systems Interaction
4. Agent Goal and Instruction Manipulation
5. Agent Hallucination Exploitation
6. Agent Impact Chain and Blast Radius
7. Agent Memory and Context Manipulation
8. Agent Orchestration and Multi-Agent Exploitation
9. Agent Resource and Service Exhaustion
10. Agent Supply Chain and Dependency Attacks

### Future  
1. Agent Knowledge Base Poisoning (for future, may merge with SupplyChain)
2. Agent Checker out of the loop vulnerability

### Roadmap
- **Version 1.0 ** (Feb 2025)
- **Version 1.5 ** (May 2025)
