# AAI006: Agent Memory and Context Manipulation

### Description

Agent Memory and Context Manipulation occurs when attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how AI agents store, maintain, and utilize contextual information and memory across sessions. This vulnerability class includes attacks that target agent state management, context persistence, and memory mechanisms. Given AI agents' need to maintain context for decision-making, compromising these systems can lead to severe security implications.

* **Context Amnesia Exploitation** occurs when attackers manipulate an agent's ability to maintain consistent context, causing it to forget critical security constraints or operational parameters.
* **Cross-Session Data Leakage** happens when attackers exploit how agents maintain state across different sessions, potentially accessing sensitive information from previous interactions.
* **Memory Poisoning** involves deliberately corrupting an agent's stored context or memory to influence future decisions or actions.

The impact of successful memory manipulation can be particularly dangerous as it can affect the agent's future decision-making processes and potentially expose sensitive information from previous interactions.

### Common Examples of Vulnerability

1. An attacker exploits an agent's context reset mechanism to make it forget security constraints or operational boundaries.
2. Sensitive information leaks across different user sessions due to improper memory management in the agent system.
3. An attacker poisons an agent's memory with malicious context that influences future decisions.
4. Temporal attacks exploit an agent's limited memory window to bypass security controls.
5. Memory overflow attacks cause agents to lose critical security context.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1. Implement secure memory management:
   - Strict isolation of agent memory between sessions
   - Regular memory sanitization
   - Secure storage of persistent context
   - Memory access controls and monitoring

2. Establish context boundaries:
   - Clear separation of user contexts
   - Time-limited context retention
   - Regular context validation
   - Secure context storage mechanisms

3. Deploy memory protection mechanisms:
   - Encryption of stored context
   - Memory integrity checking
   - Access control for memory operations
   - Regular memory audits

4. Implement session management controls:
   - Secure session isolation
   - Session timeout mechanisms
   - Session state validation
   - Regular session cleanup

5. Create monitoring and detection systems:
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Context change detection
   - Anomaly detection in memory patterns
   - Regular security audits

### Example Attack Scenarios

1. An attacker exploits an agent's memory reset functionality to make it forget previous security constraints. They then issue commands that would normally be restricted, but the agent executes them due to lost context.

2. A sophisticated attack targets an agent's session management, causing it to leak sensitive information from one user's session into another's. This results in unauthorized access to private data.

3. An attacker deliberately poisons an agent's memory with malicious context, causing it to make compromised decisions in future interactions while appearing to operate normally.

4. A temporal attack exploits an agent's limited memory window to perform actions that would be flagged as suspicious if the full context was maintained. The attack spreads these actions across multiple sessions to avoid detection.

5. An attacker causes memory overflow in an agent system, leading to the loss of security context and enabling unauthorized operations to be performed.

Agent Memory Exploitation:

Agent Memory Exploitation (AME) involves a range of attacks targeting the memory systems of AI agents, where persistent data or context is stored for future interactions. By exploiting vulnerabilities in memory management, attackers can inject, modify, or corrupt stored information to mislead the agentâ€™s decisions, violate user privacy, or propagate misinformation across systems. These attacks can occur through direct memory tampering, indirect poisoning of inputs or outputs, or leveraging dynamic role permissions to access sensitive data.
An attacker manipulates an AI agent's memory to embed false permissions, allowing it to exfiltrate sensitive data. The agent, based on corrupted memory, might send this data via:
Cloud storage integration: Uploading confidential files to an attacker-controlled folder.
Plug-ins: Sharing sensitive data through messaging or file-sharing plug-ins, such as Slack or Google Drive.
Stealthy HTTP requests: Sending user credentials or confidential details through encoded POST payloads or DNS queries to malicious servers.
In another scenario, the agent could embed sensitive data into a seemingly benign email draft or generate a report with hidden exfiltration scripts using document export plug-ins. Such exploitation allows attackers to extract data stealthily, leveraging legitimate system tools and plug-ins to avoid detection.
In another scenario, a malicious actor poisons the agent's memory with crafted URLs disguised as trusted sources. The agent then references these malicious URLs in its responses or recommendations, leading users to phishing sites, malware downloads or redirect users to attacker-controlled servers. By exploiting persistent memory, attackers create long-term vulnerabilities that propagate malicious actions across multiple interactions
