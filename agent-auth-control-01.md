# AAI001: Agent Authorization and Control Hijacking

### Description

Agent Authorization and Control Hijacking occurs when an attacker manipulates or exploits an AI agent's permission system, causing the agent to operate beyond its intended authorization boundaries. This can happen through direct manipulation of agent permissions, exploitation of role inheritance mechanisms, or hijacking of agent control systems. The vulnerability can lead to unauthorized actions, data breaches, and system compromises while maintaining the appearance of legitimate agent behavior.

* **Direct Control Hijacking** occurs when attackers gain unauthorized control over an AI agent's decision-making or execution processes, allowing them to command the agent to perform unintended actions.
* **Permission Escalation** happens when an AI agent either inadvertently or maliciously elevates its permissions beyond intended boundaries, often through role inheritance or system misconfiguration.
* **Role Inheritance Exploitation** takes place when attackers exploit the dynamic nature of agent role assignments, using temporary or inherited permissions to perform unauthorized actions while evading detection.

The impact of successful agent hijacking can be severe - from unauthorized data access to system compromise, particularly dangerous given AI agents' often elevated privileges and autonomous nature.

### Common Examples of Vulnerability

1. An AI agent inherits admin permissions temporarily for a specific task but fails to relinquish these permissions after completion, leaving an extended window for exploitation.
2. A malicious actor manipulates an agent's task queue to trick it into performing privileged actions under the guise of legitimate operations.
3. An agent's role inheritance mechanism is exploited to gain access to restricted systems or data by chaining together multiple temporary permission assignments.
4. An attacker compromises an agent's control system to issue unauthorized commands while maintaining the appearance of normal operation.
5. An agent accidentally retains elevated permissions across different execution contexts, leading to unintended privilege escalation.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1. Implement strict role-based access control (RBAC) and task-based governance for AI agents:
   - Any access permission for AI agent should be corresponding to the assigned documented task/tasks
   - Predefine minimal viable set of permissions/entitlements needed to perform the task before assigning task to an AI agent
   - As soon as task is assigned to an AI agent, entitlement permissions should be provisioned automatically
   - If the organization has mature business role management and prefer to assign a role to an agent, the following should be done: 
      - Define clear permission boundaries for each agent role
      - Implement time-limited role assignments
   - Enforce automatic permission revocation after task completion
   - Regular audit of agent permissions and roles

2. Establish robust agent activity monitoring:
   - Real-time monitoring of agent actions, assigned tasks and permission changes
   - Automated detection of unusual permission patterns
   - Logging of all permission changes, role and task assignments
   - Regular review of agent activity logs
   

3. Implement separation of control planes:
   - Separate agent control and execution environments
   - Maintain distinct permission sets for different agent functions
   - Implement approval workflows for sensitive operations
   - Establish clear boundaries between agent control systems

4. Deploy comprehensive audit trails:
   - Track all agent actions and permission changes
   - Maintain immutable logs of agent activities
   - Implement version control for agent configurations
   - Create and maintain AI agent behavior profile around assigned tasks and roles, and constantly check for behavior outlier
   - Create an exceptions handling process in case agent AI cannot perform an assigned task (data issues, lack of permissions, etc.)

5. Enforce least privilege principle:
   - Grant minimum necessary permissions for each task
   - Implement just-in-time access for elevated privileges
   - Regular review and pruning of unused permissions
   - Automatic expiration of temporary privileges

### Example Attack Scenarios

1. An attacker identifies an AI agent with temporary elevated permissions for system maintenance. By manipulating the agent's task queue, they extend the permission window and use the agent to access restricted systems under the guise of maintenance operations.

2. A malicious actor exploits an agent's role inheritance mechanism to gradually accumulate permissions across multiple systems. By chaining together seemingly legitimate tasks, they gain unauthorized access to sensitive data while appearing as normal agent operations.

3. An attacker compromises an agent's control system during a critical infrastructure maintenance task. They use the agent's legitimate access to install backdoors while the agent appears to be performing routine maintenance.

4. A sophisticated attack exploits an agent's permission caching mechanism to maintain elevated access across multiple sessions. The attacker uses this persistent access to slowly exfiltrate sensitive data through the agent's legitimate communication channels.

5. An insider threat manipulates an agent's configuration to retain admin privileges beyond their intended duration. They use these extended privileges to perform unauthorized system changes while evading detection through the agent's trusted status.

6. An execution agent-1 could be attacked by a Threat Vector and then influence  another Execution agent-2 in the same layer if there is  NO authentication or JWT based technique involved for Peer to Peer Communication by AI Agents in the same Layer. This is another important secuirty attack scenario in the Agent to Agent collaboration phase.
